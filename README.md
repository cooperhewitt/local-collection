## local-collection

This is a set of tools and scripts to make the process of creating a local copy of the Cooper Hewitt collection data a little easier.

To make use of this repository do the following:

1. Clone the "collection" repo alongside this one.
2. Run scripts from within the /bin directory
3. Place these two repos somewhere that has a lot of disk space if you plan to harvest all the images

Your directory stucture should look like the following

    .
    ..
    collection
